                <p>The Muhammad Ali Mosque or Alabaster Mosque is a mosque situated in the Citadel of Cairo in Egypt and
                    was commissioned by Muhammad Ali Pasha between 1830 and 1848.
                    Situated on the summit of the citadel, this Ottoman mosque, the largest to be built in the first
                    half of the 19th century, is, with its animated silhouette and twin minarets, the most visible
                    mosque in Cairo.
                    The mosque was built in memory of Tusun Pasha, Muhammad Ali's youngest son, who died in 1816.
                    This mosque, along with the nearby Cairo Citadel, are one of the landmarks and tourist attractions
                    of Cairo.</p>

                <h1>Building Stages</h1>
                <h2>the Castle is not the same as was</h2>
                <p>The mosque was built on the site of old Mamluk buildings in Cairo's Citadel between 1830 and 1848,
                    although not completed until the reign of Said Pasha in 1857. The architect is unknown. The
                    ground on which the mosque was erected was built with debris from the earlier buildings of the
                    Citadel.

                    Before completion of the mosque, the alabastered panels from the upper walls were taken away and
                    used for the palaces of Abbas I. The stripped walls were clad with wood painted to look like marble.
                    In 1899, the mosque showed signs of cracking and some inadequate repairs were undertaken. The
                    condition of the mosque became so dangerous that a complete scheme of restoration was ordered by
                    King Fuad in 1931 and was finally completed under King Farouk in 1939.

                    Muhammad Ali Pasha was buried in a tomb carved from Carrara marble[citation needed]. His body was
                    transferred here from Hosh al-Basha in 1857.</p>
