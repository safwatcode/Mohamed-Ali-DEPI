                    As Wāli, Ali attempted to modernize Egypt by instituting dramatic reforms in the military, economic
                    and cultural spheres. He also initiated a violent purge of the Mamluks, consolidating his rule and
                    permanently ending the Mamluk hold over Egypt. <br> <br>
                    Ali's reign marked the end of the Mamluk dynasty and the beginning of the Islamic Golden Age,
                    which lasted from 1258 to 1353 AD. <br>
                    Ali's political and economic policies were characterized by their emphasis on stability, progress,
                    and social justice. <br><br>

                        Muhammad Ali was born in the Sanjak of Kavala (modern-day Kavala), in the Rumelia Eyalet, to
                        an Albanian family from Korça. He was the second son of a Bektashi Albanian tobacco and
                        shipping merchant named Ibrahim Agha, who also served as an Ottoman commander of a small
                        unit in their hometown. His mother was Zeynep, the daughter of Çorbaci Husain
                        Agha, another Muslim Albanian notable in Kavala. When his father died at a young age,
                        Muhammad was taken and raised by his uncle Husain Agha with his cousins. As a reward for
                        Muhammad Ali's hard work, his uncle gave him the rank of "Bolukbashi" for the collection of
                        taxes in the town of Kavala. Muhammad Ali later married his cousin Amina Hanim, a wealthy
                        widow. She was the daughter of Ali Agha and Kadriye (Zeynep's sister).

                    <p>
                        After Muhammad's promising success in collecting taxes, he earned the rank of Second
                        Commander under his cousin Sarechesme Halil Agha in the Kavala Volunteer Contingent of
                        Albanian mercenaries that was sent to re-occupy Egypt following General Napoleon Bonaparte's
                        withdrawal. In 1801, his unit was sent, as part of a much larger Ottoman force, to
                        re-occupy Egypt following a brief French occupation that upended Mamluk dominance in Egypt.
                        The expedition, aboard xebecs, landed at Aboukir in the spring of 1801. One of his
                        trusted army commanders was Miralay Mustafa Bey, who had married Muhammad's sister Zubayda
                        and was the ancestor of the Yakan family.
